# Redux quiz group project

This week, we practiced working in a real dev team through mob programming.
We've built a quiz using React, Redux and styled components.

Users should be able to:
1. view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
2. answer questions and get feedback regarding their anwer right away. If correct, it should show correct, if incorrect, it should show in correct.
3. After an answer has been selected, all answers will be disabled so users can't change their answer or submit more than 1 answer.
4. see a summary page of their answers and their score.
5. learn about recycling!
